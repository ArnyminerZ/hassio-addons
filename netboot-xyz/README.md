Netboot.xyz PXE Server for Homeassistant OS

## About

netboot.xyz is a way to PXE boot various operating system installers or utilities from one place within the BIOS without the need of having to go retrieve the media to run the tool. iPXE is used to provide a user friendly menu from within the BIOS that lets you easily choose the operating system you want along with any specific types of versions or bootable flags.

You can remote attach the ISO to servers, set it up as a rescue option in Grub, or even set up your home network to boot to it by default so that itâ€™s always available.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.<br /> 
Just add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
path: /media/netboot-image
path_config: /media/netboot-config
dhcp_range: 192.168.178.200
```
<br /> 

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `path`

This option is needed. Change it depending where your ISO files and more are.

Note: it has to be somewhere in the /media folder! Other folders are not visible to this addon.

### Option: `path_config`

This option is needed. Change it depending where your netboot.xyz config files and more are.

Note: it has to be somewhere in the /media folder! Other folders are not visible to this addon.

### Option: `dhcp_range`

This option is needed. Change it depending to your network. Try using a higher IP in the last range (f.e. 100 or 200)

## Ingress

This addon supports Homeassistant Ingress. But it seems to be buggy.

## Post-Installation
Before booting for the first time, I recommend having a look at the netboot config.<br /> 
Go to http://YOUR-HOMEASSISTANT-IP:3000 -> Menus -> boot.cfg<br /> 

### Windows
Change the following line depending to your WinPE location: <br /> 
set win_base_url http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:PORT/WinPE <br /> 

example if you are hosting your extracted files directly on the netboot.xyz server: <br /> 
set win_base_url ${live_endpoint}/windows <br />
