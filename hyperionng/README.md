## About

THIS ADDON IS NOW DEPRECATED, AS I AM NOT USING HYPERION ANYMORE. YOU CAN FORK MY GIT AND TRY TO FIX AND IMPROVE IT YOURSELF. I WONT SUPPORT IT ANYMORE, SORRY.

WARNING! This addon seems not to work right now!!!

Hyperion is an opensource Bias or Ambient Lighting implementation which you might know from TV manufacturers. It supports many LED devices and video grabbers. The project is still in a alpha development stage (no stable release available). For more informations please visit: https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.
Just add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons

## Changelog & Releases

The format of the version is based on the original HyperionNG github releases added with a "-Number" for the ha addon version. (example 2.0.0-alpha.5-1)
