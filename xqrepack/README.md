xqrepack - Repack and rebuild MiWifi Images to gain SSH access and other stuff.

## About

These scripts allow you to modify the Xiaomi R3600 (AX3600) / rm1800 (AX1800) firmware image to make sure SSH and UART access is always enabled.

The default root password is password. Please remember to login to the router and change that after the upgrade. Your router settings like IP address and SSIDs are stored in the nvram and should stay the same.

âš  The script also tries its best to remove or disable phone-home binaries, and also the smart controller (AIoT) parts, leaving you with a (close to) OpenWRT router that you can configure via UCI or /etc/config. Between preserving stock functionality and privacy concerns, I would err on the side of caution and rather that some functionality be sacrificed for a router that I have more confidence to connect to the Internet.

Note that in order to get SSH access to the router initially, you need to downgrade to version 1.0.17 and exploit it first. Once you have SSH, you can use this repacking method to maintain SSH access for newer versions.<br />

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.<br /> 
Just add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons

The new firmware will be at your "firmware_path" folder and will be called "r3600-raw-img.bin"

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

### AX3600

```yaml
firmware_path: /share/miwifi_firmware/
firmware_name: miwifi_r3600_firmware_02d97_1.1.15.bin
```
<br /> 

### AX1800

```yaml
firmware_path: /share/miwifi_firmware/
firmware_name: miwifi_rm1800_firmware_df7e3_1.0.385.bin
```
<br /> 

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `firmware_path`

This option is needed. Change it depending where your firmware files folder is.<br /> 

Note: it has to be somewhere in the /share folder! Other folders are not visible to this addon.

### Option: `firmware_name`

This option is needed. Change it depending what your firmware file is called.<br /> 
NOTE: Please keep the name rm1800 inside the firmware file, if you are using a image for the AX1800. This is needed, as the modifying process for AX1800 is different than for the AX3600!
