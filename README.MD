# Home Assistant Community Add-ons by FaserF

## About

In the Subfolders you can find all my custom addons for homeassistant os (former known as hassio).

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.
